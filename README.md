# Malware-Detection-using-Neural-Network
Used an Android Permissions dataset to build neural network models to predict whether an app is malware or not based on the permissions it asks for.\
Implemented a neural network and batch gradient descent from scratch, including the steps: Forward propagation, cost computation, backpropagation, parameters updation.\
Also used Tensorflow keras to implement more neural network models.\
Compared the performances of the following variations: Rmsprop, Adam with tanh activation function in hidden layers, Adam with Leaky Relu activation function in hidden layers.\
Achieved an accuracy of around 95% in all the models.
